# BareMetalBinaryWatch
In this project I will follow STM32 Bare Metal Programming tutorial (https://vivonomicon.com/2018/04/02/bare-metal-stm32-programming-part-1-hello-arm/) and adapt it to my MCU (STM32L031K6)
ToDo:
1)Write function that takes time as argument and displays it on binary watch;
2)Configure RTC to track time;
3)Write better make file;
4)Configure sleep mode and interrupts to improve current consumption;
